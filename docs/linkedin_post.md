# LinkedIn Post: Thursday Treating Calendar Project

---

I'm excited to share my recently completed project - Thursday Treating Calendar! 🚀

This is a team rotation management application built with React+TypeScript, focused on solving the fair distribution problem for our team's Thursday treating activities.

🔍 Key highlights:
- Designed a unique hostOffset mechanism that solves fairness issues when new members join
- Built with React+TS+Vite+Supabase+Tailwind tech stack
- Implemented automatic scheduling, email reminders, and an intuitive calendar interface

💡 My biggest takeaway was solving a seemingly simple but deep business problem: how to ensure treating duties remain fairly distributed even as team members come and go. Through the hostOffset mechanism, new members neither get an unfair advantage just for joining nor are immediately burdened with treating responsibilities.

This project reaffirms that technology's value lies in solving real problems, even for something as simple as team activity scheduling.
