# LinkedIn Post: Thursday Treating Calendar Project

---

Excited to share my newest project - Thursday Treating Calendar! 🚀

Built with React+TypeScript+Vite+Supabase, this app solves our team's Thursday treating rotation problem through a unique hostOffset mechanism that ensures fairness when team members join or leave.

🔍 Tech highlights:
- Supabase Edge Functions + Resend API for reliable email notifications
- Supabase for backend database and authentication
- Fair distribution algorithm with hostOffset balancing
